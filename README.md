## About the project

Is a simple NodeJS and HTML5/CSS3 chat which i used to practice and apply some of my studies in NodeJS and Websockets. Here, i'm using the **Socket.io** package to code the websocket' part.

The original idea and references are in a RocketSeat's video on YouTube and [you can watch it by clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jXfKDYJJvo).

## How to use it

Nodemon is configured, the just run:

````
npm start
````

The server is configured on *http://localhost:3000*.

## Usage

The *index.html* is the chat' page. In the left side are the messages and in the right side is the main form. See the example below:

![](/readme-scr/main-screen.png)

You can just use with multiple pages and set an user for each one then send your message! Enjoy it.

### Some complements...

The css stuffs at the index page may be wrong at some parts. The reason is i didn't care too much about the front end part in this repo, my priority was the **NodeJS and Socket.io** parts.
